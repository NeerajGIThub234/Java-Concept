DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of solutions and problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The folder includes implementations and practice problems in various topics that are essential for mastering DSA. These topics cover a broad range of concepts, such as:

Arrays: Manipulation, searching, sorting, and pattern-related problems.
Strings: Operations like searching, matching, and manipulation.
Linked Lists: Both singly and doubly linked list problems, including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversals, and tree-based algorithms.
Searching Algorithms: Linear search, binary search, and related variations.
Sorting Algorithms: Implementations of common sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort, etc.
Recursion: Recursive problem solving, including examples and challenges.
Stacks: Implementation and problems using stacks, including applications like balancing parentheses.
Graphs: Graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS), shortest path problems, and more.
Each problem is solved with detailed explanations of the approach, algorithm, and time/space complexity where applicable. This folder serves as a valuable resource for practicing and enhancing your problem-solving skills in DSA.
